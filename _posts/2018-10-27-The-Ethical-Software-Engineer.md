### Problem: The Suggestion Box

It is always a difficult decision to make when you are not the only one being impacted. It is even more difficult to make a decision when your boss is basically the one asking you to make it, such as in this scenario we’ve been introduced to, The Suggestion Box. In this scenario, if I had been the worker that was asked to find the alleged saboteur, I think I would refuse to figure out the person’s identity, at least at that first moment.

I believe this to be the most ethical choice for the situation that we’ve been given so far. The owner of this company had made a promise to their employees that their identities would not be disclosed if they were to make a response. Therefore, we know the employee made the response expecting his identity to not be revealed.

In my opinion, just because the founder became concerned about the comment is not a good enough reason to allow him to go back on his word right away. Instead, I think I would actually suggest to the owner to make a company-wide comment that there was a concerning response that was received which suggested sabotage to the company. From here he could say that he will be on the watch for a variety of the products for defectiveness and that if he gets word of or finds anything seeming defective, that he will investigate who made the comment. This is a fairly good compromise in our scenario. It keeps the originally promised anonymous responses for the program, yet also ensures the best outcome for the company. I believe this is ethical as it keeps the original promise, while also warning every single one of the employees of the risk if they choose to sabotage. In this way, the employee that made the response now knows that if he chooses to sabotage, he runs the risk of having his identity revealed. This gives fairness to all sides, as from here forward, if that employee chooses to produce defected products, he is choosing to do so knowing that he will more than likely be caught, instead of just being guaranteed that his identity will remain unrevealed.

Although this is the decision I believe I would make in the scenario, if I had been given additional information I may treat the situation a little bit differently. For example, if I knew that the company I worked for created products which could affect the health or well-being of others I may be more willing to look up the identity without proof of a defect. In this situation, I feel that the company should do its best not to harm people, and the only way to do that would to ensure no purposeful defects to the products. I feel this is most ethical, as not only are we attempting to keep others safe, but this employee that made the response must know the importance of these products for people’s well-being and yet is willing to risk others just to sabotage a company he dislikes.
