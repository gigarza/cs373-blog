### What did you like the least about the class?

I really disliked how the was a variety in the learning each student got out of the group projects. Although there was a lot to do for each project, I really felt that I couldn't contribute much when there were 5 people trying to work on something all at once. Because of this, I didn't feel like I really learned much from those projects.


### What did you like the most about the class?

I absolutely loved the lectures. Downing is a really great lecturer and even when it's the first class of the morning, it's easy to be engaged and focused. I also felt like he explained the material well and that I left each lecture knowing something new.


### What's the most significant thing you learned?

The most significant thing I learned was the specifics of Python in the first half of the course. I knew the basics of python mostly from self-teaching when I came into the course. Throughout the lectures at the beginning of the semester, Downing went into a lot of detail about Python and different tools within python to help your code be clean and efficient. Going forward, I feel extremely comfortable with Python, almost more than any other language.


### How many hours a week did you spend coding/debugging/testing for this class?

It really depended on if there was a project due that week or not. My group did most of the projects the week before they were due, so those weeks had tons more hours. I'd say when working on the project, I spent about 20 hours in the lab with the group over the course of the week. Weeks were there were no projects due, I really spent almost no time coding.


### How many hours a week did you spend reading/studying for this class?

At the beginning of the semester, I took the readings very seriously and always made sure to complete them before they were due. Those weeks I'd say I spent about 1-3 hours reading (and taking notes/getting distracted), depending on the length of the readings for the week. However, about half way through the semester I stopped doing the readings so that number really dwindled down. I only studied the week of a test, but those weeks I'd spend at least 12 hours or more studying.


### How many lines of code do you think you wrote?

Honestly, I'm not that sure. I'd say at least 500, but most of it was from all different places (no large chunks).


### What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?

Before this course, I didn't know React at all. However, throughout the project I was really able to see how convenient it is to use for frontend development, and definitely assists in creating a cleaner design.


### What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?

I'd say the most useful tool was Docker-Compose. This tool created a way to work with multiple containers to run both the backend and frontend of our website at the same time.


### If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?

Although I believe it would be more time consuming, I almost want to say that I'd have group members rotate roles throughout projects. If the same person is always working on the backend because that's what they are good at, they may never get a chance to learn how to use the frontend tools. If roles were rotated throughout different phases, then it would be guaranteed each member would get a taste of all the different tools being used in the project, and therefore result in the most learning across the board.
